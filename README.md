# RateZen
RateZen is a powerful rate limiting solution designed for developers seeking to control and manage API traffic efficiently.

In Milestone 1, RateZen provides a solid foundation by supporting rate limiting for the HTTP protocol.

## Key Milestone 1 Features of RateZen:

- **HTTP Rate Limiting:** RateZen offers rate limiting capabilities for HTTP requests, ensuring that your web-based APIs and applications can manage incoming traffic effectively.

- **Token Bucket Algorithm:** Our Token Bucket rate limiting algorithm allows you to define and enforce rate limits, preventing excessive requests and protecting your resources.

- **Easy Integration:** RateZen is designed with developers in mind, offering straightforward integration into your applications. Protect your API endpoints with just a few lines of code.

- **Basic Metrics:** While in Milestone 1, RateZen provides basic metrics to help you monitor the usage patterns of your API and track rate limit violations.

RateZen simplifies the process of implementing rate limiting for HTTP-based APIs, enabling you to optimize performance and ensure fair resource allocation. As we continue to evolve, future milestones will expand RateZen's capabilities to support multiple protocols and more advanced features.
